# Container

Renders a container based on a Grid. Alternate method to achieve the same as max-width. Different columns are used, to simulate a max-width. Difference, however, is we can easily breakout elements out of the container, both left or right.

[Example](../examples/container.html)

## Instructions

Import the SCSS for the component:

```scss
@import "keplerstein-component-library/scss/container";
```

There are 2 container mixins to use in your styles. 
Use the SCSS mixins in your styles. Note: these styles are already included in the boilerplate Craft setup.

```scss

```
